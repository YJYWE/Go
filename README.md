# Intelligent Q&A System based on Go and Transformers

This project is a full-stack intelligent question-answering system that combines a Go-based backend with Transformer-based AI models (e.g., GPT or BERT). It supports semantic search, real-time inference, and user interaction through RESTful APIs.

## 🧠 Features

- Full-stack architecture powered by Go and modern AI
- Transformer-based QA using pretrained or fine-tuned models
- RESTful API interface for frontend integration
- Optional vector database for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Modular and extensible codebase

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+
- Python 3.8+
- pip / virtualenv
- Docker (optional, for vector DB or deployment)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-project.git
cd your-project
````

### Backend (Go)

```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```

### AI Model (Python)

```bash
cd model
python app.py
```

> You can use FastAPI or Flask to serve the model as an API endpoint.

### Configuration

Set up `.env` for backend and model, e.g.:

```
MODEL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/answer
VECTOR_DB_URL=http://localhost:6333
```

## 🧪 Example API Usage

```http
POST /api/ask
{
  "question": "What is the capital of Australia?"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "answer": "Canberra"
}
```

## 📦 Deployment

You can deploy the backend with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t go-ai-backend ./backend
docker run -p 8080:8080 go-ai-backend
```
